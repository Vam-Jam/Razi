<p align = 'center'> Currently being developed.</p>

# Why ?
Razi is a bot made to replace Riza. You can find riza's source code [here - Click me](https://github.com/Vam-Jam/Riza_).
The main issue with riza was poor error handling, timing out and much more. To fix this, i wanted to start over from scratch and make it far more easier to use and maintain.

Razi is using [serenity-rs api](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)

# Can I use it in my server?
Go for it, however this bot will contain code thats aimed for my personal uses, this will cause issues for unrelated servers<br>
I would recommend you steal the parts you like and use them in your own project.

# Thank you notes:
- Thank you to the serenity-rs team, amazing api and helpful community.
- Caesar for making the picture
